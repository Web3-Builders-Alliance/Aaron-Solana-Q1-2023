/*

What are the concepts (borrowing, ownership, vectors etc)
- seems major reference points here are hte parameters and then use of accounts.iter();
What is the organization?
- code is very organized and easy to read
What is the contract doing? What is the mechanism? 
- just verifying the account inputs. it doen't actually do anything
How could it be better? More efficient? Safer?
The code could be safer and better ifâ€¦..add an acct.len >=5 check. though more accounts doesn't seem to hurt this program, it would reduce the liklihood of a user submitting wrong accounts (or misunderstanding account parameters. )
