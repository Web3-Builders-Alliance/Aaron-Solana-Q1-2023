SPL Token Library CreateAccount



What are the concepts (borrowing, ownership, vectors etc)
What is the organization? 
What is the contract doing? What is the mechanism? 
How could it be better? More efficient? Safer? 
As we shift to week 2 (CLUSTER II- this one is two weeks long), your lens of Native Rust -> Anchor should be explored, annotated, and analyzed.

/*

What are the concepts (borrowing, ownership, vectors etc)
- what i like about this is the use of conditionals to direct certain outcomes/actions. i think this can give us a lot of flex to create vs recreate
What is the organization?
- code is very organized and easy to read
What is the contract doing? What is the mechanism? 
- creating a new SPL token account if one doesn't exist already using pda derviation checks. 
How could it be better? More efficient? Safer?
The code could be safer and better ifâ€¦.
--dunno...lots of really good checks and errors in here. 


NOTE: since this was a long one...just gonna do 2 journals this week!
